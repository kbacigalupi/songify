## Generating a recommended song

The main function of the songify package is to generate a song or a playlist given user inputs including genre, mode, energy, valence, danceability, and instrumentalness. Let's see how we can accomplish this. First, load the `songify` package.

```{r setup}
library(songify)
```

Then, use the `rec_song()` function to generate a song recommendation. We'll retrieve information about a pop song, so we'll set the `genre` argument as 'pop' and the `energy` will be set to 0.8. For the parameters `energy`, `mode`, `valence`, `danceability`, `instrumentalness` can be enters on a sliding scale from 0.0-1.0. You can be as specific as you want and go to many decimal places.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
a_song <- rec_song("pop", energy = 0.8, instrumentalness = 1)
```

You can also use S3 methods to print and summarize the information about your song. The `summary()` method returns a data frame.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(a_song)
summary(a_song)
```

The objects returned by `rec_song()` are of the S3 class `song` 

To generate the playlist, use the `rec_playlist()` function. We'll retrieve a playlist using an argument for `genre` and `nsongs` which will be the number of songs you want in your playlist. We will retrieve a playlist for 5 songs. The objects returned are of class `playlist`. Reccomending a playlist can take a significant ammount of time - as would a playlist made with love from your friend. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
a_playlist <- rec_playlist("pop", 5)
class(a_playlist)
```

You can also use S3 methods to print and summarize a given playlist. The `summary()` method returns a data frame which can be used for further data analysis. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(a_playlist)
summary(a_playlist)
```

## Song Bank Data

The `songify` package also comes with a built in data set with all of the songs by Taylor Swift (as of April 2024). This is an example of the categories that the `rec_song()` function uses to pull from.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
songify::song_bank
```
